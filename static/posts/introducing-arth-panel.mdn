# What is Arth Panel?

Arth Panel is free and open-source software that allows you to run and manage your own Minecraft servers with ease. You can specify the software (paper, velocity, forge, etc), version, add worldgen mods like Terralith when creating the server, easily access each server's terminal, and safely add plugins from Modrinth. Arth Panel runs on the web, enabling others and you to use it from any device, anywhere in the world. You can even make some money by charging people to create servers on your panel!

## Creation
Arth Panel was created simply because I was dissatisfied with both hosting services like Apex and Realms as well as self-hosted panels like Pterodactyl. While paying a host works for most people, I wanted to self-host to avoid paying a monthly fee, as well as to get experience in Linux. I decided to make an alternative to self-hosted panels like PufferPanel and Pterodactyl after having both break and having to spend a good amount of time recovering the data of the servers inside.  

On **September 17**, Arth Panel's frontend was created on GitHub.  

On **September 19**, We had our first other contributor.  

On **September 28**, Arth Panel's backend was created on GitHub.
Since then, Arth Panel has received many commits most weeks besides a small break in November.  

On **December 1**, Arth Panel's repositories moved from GitHub to Codeberg due to ethical concerns with GitHub as well as to encourage a more diverse developer ecosystem.  

On **January 1**, Arth Panel went into beta with its largest update yet.  

## What's Next? 
The current focus is bug fixing, security, and documentation. We eventually want to add ways to federate with other panels, ways to login with platforms like discord and google, we want to package pocketbase (a mini third backend for accounts) with quartz, and eventually add end-to-end encryption where possible.
