With 20+ page privacy policies common on Minecraft hosting services, it's often hard to tell how your data is really being handled. When designing our privacy practices, we wanted to make sure that they were not just better than the leading competitors, but as good as they could possibly be.

## Privacy policy length
While policy length is not as important as the policies themselves, it's still important because it's hard to read every clause in a policy that's too long.
Apex Hosting, often considered the most popular hosting service has a policy over 20 pages long, which is **ten times** longer than our privacy policy at 2 pages (Since most privacy policies don't contain actual pages, they will be measured via pagelength on 11pt font). In addition, Arth Hosting's privacy policy at 2 pages is still shorter than Shockbyte's 3 pages and BisectHosting's 7 pages.

## Privacy far beyond the norm
We encourage you to look at the following policies as well as our [own privacy policy](https://arthmc.xyz/privacy) yourself.    

One thing you'll find in almost every third-party section of privacy policies is exemptions for parties that assist in the operation of the service.
> We may share your personal information with companies or individuals that assist us in providing services to you.

While there will always be some third parties necessary, like a payment processor, we keep this to an absolute minimum. As of the time of writing, we don't use any cloud computing services, nor do we use tools like Google Analytics that would introduce trackers to our users.  
In addition to 'necessary' third parties, it's very common for services to supply information to all sorts of third parties.
> Your personal information may be utilized by us or shared with partners, advertisers, advertising networks, social media platforms, analytics companies, and similar third parties to customize your advertising and marketing experiences.

> It's also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral tracking

We also make sure all our software is [open-source](https://codeberg.org/arth), meaning the code behind our website, panel, etc is publicly viewable. Unlike closed-source panels like what most services have, you don't have to take our word that data isn't being sent to anyone not outlined on our policy, you can see for yourself!


## We want your feedback
We truly want to make sure we're excelling in privacy in everything we do, and we hope that the results speak for themselves. If you think something should be improved in our [privacy policy](https://arthmc.xyz/privacy), we'd love to hear your idea at business@arthmc.xyz.
