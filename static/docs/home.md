Arth Quartz provides a REST api allowing frontends to create and manage serves, change settings, access a server's terminal, and more. Besides contributing to Observer, you may want to know this to create an alternative frontend, or to manage your servers by directly making web requests. 

Future Plans: We plan to implement auth token security soon. You will need to put the token in a header.
