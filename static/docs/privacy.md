This is the second version of the Arth privacy policy, published 11:00 AM Central Standard Time on January the 29th, 2022. This version will go into effect on Feb 28th, 2023.

# Your data on Arth Hosting

- When you delete a server you've made, all data relating to that server will be immediately deleted.
- The data tied to your account is your email, your password, what servers you own.

# Consent

By using our website, you hereby consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its Terms and Conditions. 

# Cookies

Like most other websites, our websites use 'cookies', data that is stored on your browser, to provide basic features like light/dark mode, using accounts, and other preferences. They are not stored in the cloud but on your computer, so you can delete them from your browser.

# Third Parties

We try to minimize third parties whenever possible for privacy and efficiency's sake. Third party tools used by many websites such as Google AdSense are the primary collectors of data, so we are especially focused on minimizing their roles in our services.

### Web Hosting

Most hosting services such as AWS collect all IP Addresses, Data & Time, and more as part of their analytics. We currently host our own websites, so your IP Address and other info will not be available to anyone besides us.

### Source Code Hosting

Source code hosting is used by almost everyone who is developing software, including us. Normally the service used is GitHub, a proprietary website owned by Microsoft based in the United States of America. Since December 1st, 2022, Arth has been exclusively using Codeberg, an open-source website governed by Codeberg e.v, a democratic organization based in the European Union. Codeberg's privacy policy can be found [here](https://codeberg.org/Codeberg/org/src/branch/main/PrivacyPolicy.md)

### Analytics

Many websites use analytics to gather data about how popular their services are, where their users are located, etc. We currently do not have analytics, but if we do in the future it will not be Google Analytics.

### Ads

Ads currently would serve no purpose on our websites and services, but if the need arises for them in the future, we will avoid Google AdSense and will likely use the upcoming [AdRinth](https://adrinth.com) network.




Changes to these terms:
- If changes to these terms are needed, we will put them into effect 30 days after the changes are made visible.
