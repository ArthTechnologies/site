  "landing.faq.1.title": "Which plan do I need?",
  "landing.faq.1.desc": "If your server will be vanilla and have only a few friends playing on it, the basic plan has more than enough RAM for your needs. <b>If you're expecting many players on at once</b>, you'll likely need the extra RAM that the premium plan provides. Likewise, many modpacks will run well with the plus plan as long as you don't have too many players. However, <b>if your modpack reccomends more than 4GB of RAM</b> or you're planning on having more than a few players, you'll need the premium plan.",
  "landing.faq.2.title": "Are Dynmap and Simple Voice Chat supported?",
  "landing.faq.2.desc": "Yes. Not only do we support Dynmap and Simple Voice Chat, but we're also one of the few hosts that offer <b>automatic setup</b>. All you have to do is add the plugin, restart the server, and you're good to go!",
  "landing.faq.3.title": "What is Geyser and why is it important?",
  "landing.faq.3.desc": "Tens of millions of people play on each major edition of Minecraft- Java and Bedrock. In 2019 developers in the Minecraft community created the Geyser program which allows Bedrock players to join Java Edition servers. It's now used all across the industry, but most competitors still require some setup that could be confusing for beginners. There's a good chance many of your potential players are on Bedrock Edition, so it's important to have Geyser support.",
